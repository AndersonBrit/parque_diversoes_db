This project consists of the development of a **relational database** for managing an **amusement park**.  
The main goal is to organise and relate information about attractions, maintenance records, employees, visitors and tickets, ensuring **data integrity**, **consistency** and **good database design practices**.

The database was developed using **MySQL** and serves as both an **academic project** and a **portfolio piece**, demonstrating fundamental knowledge of **relational databases**.

## 🗄️ Database Structure

The database is composed of **6 main tables**, organised using a normalised structure:

- **Atracao** — Information about the park attractions  
- **Manutencao** — Maintenance records for attractions  
- **Funcionario** — Employees responsible for maintenance  
- **Manutencao_Funcionario** — Associative table (N:M relationship)  
- **Visitante** — Park visitors  
- **Bilhete** — Tickets purchased for attractions  

Includes:

- **1:N** and **N:M** relationships  
- Primary and foreign keys  
- Constraints (`CHECK`, `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT`)  
- Indexes to optimise query performance  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project was created with the purpose of:

- Applying **database modelling concepts**
- Working with **1:N** and **N:M** relationships
- Ensuring **referential integrity**
- Applying **SQL best practices**
- Creating a **realistic and functional** database
- Consolidating knowledge acquired in the **GPSI course**
